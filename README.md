# ECG-Arrhythmia-Classification-in-2D-CNN
This is an implementaion based on this paper, "ECG arrhythmia classification using a 2-D convolutional neural network", Tae Joon Jun et al., CVPR 2018." with some personal modifications

Dataset:
This repo adapts MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database(https://physionet.org/physiobank/database/mitdb/) as training and testing dataset.The download file can be found under "/mit_arrythmia_dat/".

There are more contents to be fulfilled in the future.
